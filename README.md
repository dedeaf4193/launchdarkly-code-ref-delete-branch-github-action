## 🛠 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Visit the Releases Page

### Step 2: Download the Action
On the Releases page, look for the latest version. Click on it, and you will see a list of assets. Download the action file; it is usually named something like `launchdarkly-code-ref-delete-branch-github-action.tar.gz`. 

### Step 3: Add the Action to Your Repository
1. Open your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab.
3. Then click on **"New workflow"** or **"Set up a workflow yourself"**.
